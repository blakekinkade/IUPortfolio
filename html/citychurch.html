  <h2 class='headers'>PROBLEM:</h2>
    <div class='material'>
      <p>I did this as a personal project when I was not only looking for a short project to do, but also when I ran into the current City Church app.<br><br>

      City Church is a recent startup church in Evansville, IN. My father being the pastor who planted it, I’ve been part of it since the very beginning. As the church began to grow, there became an increasing need for an app to be made for regular attendees. As I have continued to use the app since its beginnings, I have struggled and struggled to make sense of its navigation, layout, and visual aesthetics. I believed that the app could be redesigned to be much more efficient and effective.</p>
    </div>
  <h2 class='headers'>BRAINSTORMING AND RESEARCH:</h2>
    <div class='material'>
      <p>I came up with a set of questions to base my research and future decisions on.
      <ol>
        <li>Who are the users?</li>

        <li>How often do attendees open the app per week?</li>

        <li>How many people use a digital bible opposed to a physical bible?</li>

        <li>What do attendees like about the app?</li>

        <li>What are the attendees’ belief on the purpose of the app?</li>

        <li>What are the attendees’ belief on the target audience of the app?</li>

        <li>What do attendees use the app for?</li></ol></p>
    </div>
  <h2 class='subone'>User Interviews & Usability Test</h2>
    <div class='material'>
      <p>After conducting user interviews of members of the church, I found that there were primarily two types of users for the app:
      <ul>
        <li>Users who open the app on Sundays to access Bible and give digitally.</li>

        <li>Users who access the app at various points in the week to listen to sermons, give, look at upcoming events, etc.</li>
      </ul>
		<p>I also was able to get a sense of the overall perception that users have of the app, which is that the app is a “one stop shop” for the regular attendants of the church.</p>

		<p>I took all of my notes and observations from the interviews and created an Affinity Diagram, resulting in the development of sections for each note. Here are what users said:</p></p>
	</div>
  <h2 class='subtwo'>Sermons</h2>
    <p class='subthree'><b>Positives</b></p>
    <div class='material'>
      <ul>
        <li>can listen to them from anywhere (as it’s mobile-based)</li>

        <li>Have sermon play in background while using your phone for something else</li>

        <li>The buttons to rewind and fast forward 15 seconds are nice because it eliminates the need to try and drag with your finger to the desired spot, which usually ends in screwing it all up.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class='subthree'><b>Negatives</b></p>
    <div class='material'>
      <ul>
        <li>“There is no way to tell what the particular sermon is about. What topic is this sermon dealing with? I have to go through each sermon to try and find the topic I am looking for.”</li>

        <li>The sermon notes are there, but it takes me to a webpage, and I constantly close out of it accidentally.</li>

        <li>In order to take notes and/or save them, I am required to create some account on something, and I don’t want to create or have another account.</li></ul>
	</div>
  <h2 class='subtwo'>Giving</h2>
    <p class='subthree'><b>Positives</b></p>
    <div class='material'>
      <ul>
        <li>I love being able to give without having to do any signup or signin, although I do wish this was the main option instead of logging into an account.</li></ul>
    </div>
	<p class='subthree'><b>Negatives</b></p>
    <div class='material'>
      <ul>
        <li>Just like other things on this app, clicking on giving takes me to an external webpage. I don’t like this as it creates more confusion on my part.</li></ul>
	</div>
  <h2 class='subtwo'>Upcoming Events</h2>
    <p class='subthree'><b>Positives</b></p>
    <div class='material'>
      <ul>
        <li>Very simple for me to understand, for anyone to understand.</li>

        <li>Love the ability to add an event to my personal calendar.</li></ul>
	</div>
    <p class='subthree'><b>Negatives</b></p>
    <div class='material'>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s just a long list of dates, I would much rather have a visual calendar-like thing.</li>

        <li>There is no further information when I click on a date, just more text of the same exact information (date and time).</li>

        <li>One complaint regarding the whole app was that there exists three navigation options upon opening the app, and users don’t know which one to use.</li></ul></p>
	</div>
  <h2 class='subone'>User Flow</h2>
    <div class='material'>
      <p>Though it’s simple, I created a user flow to better identify the issues with the navigation and layout. Many of the important sections and uses of the app are separated from other important sections, and it requires users go back and essentially “retrace their steps”.</p>
      <img alt='User Flow' class='pictures' src='/images/userflow.png'>
    </div>
  <h2 class='subone'>Personas</h2>
    <div class='material'>
     <p> As stated above, I found that there are primarily two types of users. To understand and visualize the users, I created two personas that describe the types.<br><br></p>
      <img alt='Persona' class='pictures' src='/images/persona1.png'>
      <img alt='Persona' class='pictures' src='/images/persona2.png'>
    </div>

  <h2 class='headers'>REDESIGN:</h2>
    <img alt='Redesign' class='pictures' src='/images/citychurchscreens1.png'>
    <img alt='Redesign' class='pictures' src='/images/citychurchscreens2.png'>
    <img alt='Redesign' class='pictures' src='/images/citychurchscreens3.png'>
    <iframe class='pictures' src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/240759861" width="1040" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


  <h2 class='headers'>REFLECTIONS AND COMMENTS</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project was to create a user experience that adheres to the specific user needs and make research-driven design decisions. Because the users of the church (as reflected with the personas) vary, I wanted to make the screens and interactions as simple as possible. Usability testing is currently in progress.<br>
    Unfortunately, there were a few constraints with the redesign. I was unable to redesign the “Giving” page as that is tied into a system that the church uses for financial concerns. There also were complaints/compliments regarding things like the ability to listen to the sermon while doing something else on your phone. I was unable to visualize that due to the length of time on this project.</p>
