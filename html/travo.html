  <h2 class='headers'>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
    <p> 
      I participated in Startup Weekend Bloomington and was placed on a team of five, which included an aspiring CPA, Entrepreneur, and two developers, with me being the UX Designer. We had 52 hours to take an idea from scratch (the Team Lead already had the idea) and create a complete “proposal” to a group of judges that would determine the winning group (of which were 3).
    </p>
  <h2 class='headers'>PROBLEM:</h2>
      <div class='material'>
        <p>Imagine a college student named Mary. Mary is in the Alpha Phi sorority at IU. Last Friday night, she went to a social event at Delta Chi. Like all considerate fraternities, the gentlemen of Delta Chi utilize a system of sober drivers to ensure their event guests arrive home safely. Unfortunately for Mary, she only has a phone number for one driver, the popular D Chi, and he was booked with other riders for more than two hours. Mary decided she did not want to wait that long to get home. She considered walking the 14 blocks, but it was dark and late, so she decided to bite the bullet and pay the surging Uber fares. What if Mary had an app that could connect her to the other drivers available that night?</p>
      </div>
  <h2 class='headers'>SOLUTION</h2>
    <p>
      The solution created is Travo, the ride sharing platform for the Greek system. Travo allows local administrators of the sororities and fraternities to add rosters of riders to efficiently connect with volunteer drivers from their fraternities and sororities. The app will also provide live tracking of rides to help maintain records to improve safety and accountability.
    </p>
  <h2 class='headers'>BRAINSTORMING AND RESEARCH</h2>
    <div class='material'>
      <p>I came up with a set of questions to base my research and future decisions on. Another team member and I went out on Kirkwood Avenue and asked the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Are you apart of Greek Life?</li>
        <li>How do you get to the social events of Greek Life?</li>
        <li>What's the most frustrating part of that?</li>
        <li>How often do you use Uber on the weekends?</li>
        <li>What is your experience with pledge rides?</li>
        <li>Would you use an Uber-like app that offers free rides for frat students?</li>
      </ol></p></div><br><br>
  <h2>User Interviews and Usability Test</h2>
    <p>After asking every student we could find if they are a part of Greek Life, we got an overwhelming response to our questions. All of the people claimed that their most frustrating part of attending social events was waiting for the driver to pick them up (as the driver had other people to pick up first).<br>
    *We also conducted online surveys with people at IU as well as Greek members from Syracuse and Tulane University.*<br><br>
    We got an overwhelming response to the questions. Every single Greek member stated that the most frustrating part of their attendance to social events was waiting to be picked up. Roughly 80% of them also said that it’s the biggest problem regarding the members’ daily lives within the Greek community.<br><br>
    Below are also some quotes from the “higher ups” of the Greek Community.<br><br>

    “I think that is a great premise. There is so much potential to better organize rides and make them far more efficient and safe.   I would love to have this app at my disposal. As a fraternity president, this would give me one less thing to worry about during social events.”<i>-John Frasier, President of Tau Epsilon Phi Fraternity</i><br><br>

    “We desperately need a service like this for our fraternity.”<i>-Brad Sadoff, Phi Kappa Sigma, Vice President of Student Affairs</i><br><br>

    “Honestly, now that I have a better idea of what you’re aiming for with this app I think this is an amazing idea that our Fraternity could utilize.”<i>-Ben Axelrod, Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity</i>
    </p><br><br>
<h2>User Flows</h2>
  <p>Before taking the time to create the low fidelity and high fidelity designs, I wanted to create a user flow based on the research and our team’s overall thoughts. This is extremely simple as we wanted to make the app very minimal given that we have a (relatively) small target audience. Having a small and specific target audience eliminates the need to have ample options/features that adhere to a wide variety of users.<br>

  </p>
<h2 class='headers'>WIREFRAMES</h2>
    <p>After the user flow and research was done with their initial stages, I started on creating the wireframes for each screen. With the app, we had decided on three “roles” associated with the users of the app, that being the drivers, riders, and administrators. Because of both the limited time and the criteria the judges were to judge the projects on, we put the design focus on the riders’ screens as they are the primary users.

<h2 class='headers'>PROTOTYPE</h2>

  </p>
<h2 class='headers'>ADDITIONAL</h2>
  <p>We presented this to a panel of judges and ended up getting 1st place. The app is currently being worked on by all of us, with the hopes of beta testing it this upcoming semester at IU.
