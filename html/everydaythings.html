  <h2 class='headers'>PROBLEM:</h2>
    <div class='material'> 
      <p>This was the first assignment given to us in the I300 (Foundations of Human Computer Interaction) class. The task was to find a current design that you are interested in improving.<br><br>
      Seating arrangements in large classrooms are poorly designed due to the small space in between the rows. The current process of getting to seats that aren’t at the very end require one’s backpack to be taken off, people already sitting in seats to stand up so one can get through, and you still end up hitting people, tripping, damaging materials in backpacks, etc. Teachers and professors unfortunately are the ones who often are most affected as students leaving early (for whatever reason) completely disrupt class by simply trying to get out of their row and leave.<br><br>
      Immediately following the start of finding a design problem in the SRSC, I thought of  this design problem, and then took a picture of the “problem” and thought of potential solutions and ideas.</p>
    </div>
  <h2 class='headers'>BRAINSTORMING AND RESEARCH:</h2>
    <div class='material'>
        <p>I took a picture of the width students have between each row and began sketching out ideas.<br></p>
	<a href="/images/picture1.jpg" data-fancybox><img class='pictures1' src='/images/picture1.jpg'></a>
	<a href="/images/picture2.jpg" data-fancybox><img class='pictures1' src='/images/picture2.jpg'></a>
	<a href="/images/picture3.jpg" data-fancybox><img class='pictures1' src='/images/picture3.jpg'></a>
	<a href="/images/picture4.jpg" data-fancybox><img class='pictures1' src='/images/picture4.jpg'></a>

        <p>After getting the measurements, I refined some of my brainstorming ideas to match the rough measurements I took of the classroom. The sketches are below.</p>
    </div>
  <h2 class='headers'>SOLUTION</h2>
    <div class='material'>
      <p>Despite the enervating requirement of adhering to the measurements, I believe I came up with a solution that would work well. The sketches are below:<br></p>
	<a href="/images/solution1.png" data-fancybox><img class='pictures1' src='/images/solution1.png'></a>
	<a href="/images/solution2.png" data-fancybox><img class='pictures1' src='/images/solution2.png'></a>
          <br>

      <p>My idea centered around different “levels”. In so many of these big classrooms, there is so much empty space from roughly 5-6 ft from the floor all the way to the ceiling. I thought that by utilizing all the space we can, we could keep the number of seats the same and still provide room in between rows (or in this case, levels). Instead of just having chairs with a tiny connected desk, I made it be one long desk. The chairs accompanying the desk either are connected to the desk and swivel out or separate, but cannot go past a marked line (both of these options ideally would keep enough space for students to get in and out of easily). In the sketch, I used a dotted line. The reason I believe this would keep the number of seats the same is because long desks often allow for more chairs (as they offer more space than the current big and thick seats connected to the floor). I also would have had only one aisle that runs through the middle of the classroom, allowing for more seats to be implemented.<br><p>
    </div>
  <h2 class='headers'>Additional</h2>
    <p>
      This was actually one of the most fun projects I did, despite the small time span. If given more time, I would have not only performed more accurate and precise measurements, but also would’ve tried to construct a digital architectural view of what my solution would look like, as one can only do so much with sketching and/or explaining with words.</p>
