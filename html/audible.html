  <h2 class='headers'>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
    <p> Divided into groups of 3 to 4, each team was prompted with challenges Audible, an Amazon Company, is currently facing. As Team H, we decided to focus on the highlighting feature with regards to accommodating the driving users as our primary target. 
    </p>
  <h2 class='headers'>PROBLEM:</h2>
      <div class='material'>
        <p>Currently, Audible is equipped with a driving mode for users and is represented by a car icon at the top of the screen. However, users have trouble highlighting and bookmarking passages while driving. How can we solve this and present a solution that allows users to easily highlight passages while driving?</p>     
      </div>

  <h2 class='headers'>BRAINSTORMING AND RESEARCH</h2>
    <div class='material'>
        <h2>User Interviews and Survey</h2>
      <p>We first dissected the current Audible app and investigated the Driving Mode, then proceeded to get on the subreddit of Amazon Audible and created a survey to gather more information about users' feelings and thoughts on the current app.
      <ol>
        <li>How old are you?</li>
        <li>Where are you from?</li>
        <li>What do you often listen to on Audible? (fiction, non-fiction, textbooks, articles, podcasts, news, magazines, etc.)</li>
        <li>How long does your commute have to be to turn on Audible?</li>
        <li>What platform are you using the application on?</li>
        <li>What are your goals of listening during your commute?</li>
        <li>Do you put the application in driving mode? Why or why not?</li>
        <li>Do you use the clip tool while driving?</li>
        <li>What type of things do you usually clip?</li>
        <li>Do you find the driving mode easy to use? Convenient?</li>
        <li>Why do you enjoy listening to Audible while commuting?</li>
        <li>What problems do you face with Audible while driving?</li>
      </ol></p></div>
<h2 id='Insights'>Insights</h2>
    <p>After 132 responses from the survey and 9 formal interviews, we gained the following insights:
    <div class='material'>
      <ul>
        <li>78.8% of users do not use driving mode due to poor UI, with roughly half of those users being completely unaware driving mode even existed.</li>

        <li>For those who did use driving mode, users said the most important aspects of design for driving is bigger buttons and safer interactions</li>

        <li>Users were unclear of the difference between "clip" and "bookmarking".</li>
        <li>Users often missed only small snippets of audio due to diverted attention.</li>
        <li>Users highlighted when reading actual physical books.</li>
        <li>Users want to highlight while driving, but are unable to safely do so as it requires interaction with the user interface of the phone, therefore taking the eyes off the road..</li>

      </ul>
    </div></p>


  <h2 class='headers'>REDESIGN:</h2>
      <p>With these insights in mind, we set out to completely redesign the user interface of Audible. We understood that this was perhaps a bold move on our part, but we felt it necessary for a multitude of reasons. As driving mode was our focus and because users currently don't use it, we decided to create an inclusive design that serves as both driving mode and normal mode.</p><br><br>

          <h2>Redesign In-Depth</h2>
  <p>The selected audiobook display is completely redesigned and revamped to create a cohesive interaction for any user. Beginning on the far right, the defaulted open sidebar is shown. Inside the sidebar are icons and options to less frequently used functions such as chapters, speed, volume, a sleep timer, and the three dotted icon indicating additional options. New to the sidebar is a setting icon that allows the user to customize the third large button with the function they desire and a storage icon which takes users to their saved bookmarks and highlights. Given the insights of the uncertainty between "clip" and "bookmarking", we removed the term "clip" and then separated common known tools such as highlighting and bookmarking into different actions. Bookmarking is a placeholder for a specific point in the book, while highlighting is marking a range of information.<br><br>

  There are three primary buttons for users to click on. The first two, voice control and fast forwarding/rewinding, are permanent as those are two of the most used buttons. However, users can change the third button depending on their personal choice. In our research, some users said suggested being able to customize the option of the third tool as some may be more used than others. We changed the default length of fast forwarding and rewinding to 15 seconds as opposed to 30 seconds in the current Audible app. Users indicated that they often miss small snippets of their book due to focusing on changing lanes, being extra cautious in parking lots, or simply their own daydreaming or distracting thoughts. <br><br>

  The most prominent solution for the highlighting tool was to create a function that could be used whether a user is actively participating with the mobile interface or not. For those who are present in the interaction, a highlighting icon is displayed and is the ideal option to perform highlighting. The chosen icon mimics a common tool users see in applications that allow for text modification such Word, PowerPoint, most email providers, etc. A user can infer its function based on familiar and common knowledge or experience. Initially the design created had the pen of the icon is colored in while the block below remains as an outline, however, there was confusion on the icon function. The shading continues being displayed while a message pops up, instructing user input. The user has two options: save and edit later or edit. We chose to add “save and edit later” over simply instructing to “save” because we wanted to avoid any confusion that a user would need to click save before editing if the user wanted to edit at that moment. As stated in the insights, users highlighted when reading actual books, so highlighting when listening to books should be able to happen.<br><br>

  In the scenario of driving, we concluded that the safest option for highlighting is voice control. Our secondary research showed us that voice control is a technology that is only going to continue to grow, and given the fact that Audible has a few commands already established (though not any for highlighting), it seemed like a viable option. When a user is driving and wants to highlight what was just said, the user will say, “Hey Alexa”, and the audio will automatically pause. Alexa will then play a ding that indicates the user can begin speaking. The user will then simply say, “Highlight”, and the last 30 seconds will be highlighted and saved (can be edited manually after the commute). After the command, Alexa waits 5 seconds for another command and, if none are given, plays a closing ding and closes itself to resume the audio.

  As stated in the insights, users were unable to safely highlight while driving, but adding voice command eliminates the need for interaction with the interface and allows the user to continue to keep their eyes on the road.

  <h2 class='headers'>REFLECTIONS AND COMMENTS</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project was to create a user experience that adheres to the specific user needs and make research-driven design decisions. Because the users of the church (as reflected with the personas) vary, I wanted to make the screens and interactions as simple as possible. Usability testing is currently in progress.<br>
    Unfortunately, there were a few constraints with the redesign. I was unable to redesign the “Giving” page as that is tied into a system that the church uses for financial concerns. There also were complaints/compliments regarding things like the ability to listen to the sermon while doing something else on your phone. I was unable to visualize that due to the length of time on this project.</p>
