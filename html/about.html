			<div class='bio'><h3>Background</h3><p>I am currently a junior attending Indiana University while majoring in Informatics. I am originally from Dallas, TX, but after 15 wonderful years of living in where I continue to call home, my family relocated to Evansville, IN due to my dad’s job. As one can guess, Evansville and Dallas are two vastly different cities, so to say I had to adjust would be an understatement. I quickly learned that Evansville and I did not match well, but despite my disapproval of the city, there have been a multitude of positive things that have come out of it, yet two stand out the most. First, Evansville gave me the opportunity to work at its biggest technology store as a trainer. It was my job to teach clients about their devices, whether that be computers, phone, tablets, or even smart TV’s. It was this that led me to discover my love for not only technology, but also people. I taught over 300 clients, and due to my performance, eventually became Senior Trainer in charge of the whole department. This love for technology and people influenced my choice of university, and upon discovering IU’s Informatics department, the choice was made. I was able to attend a prestigious university that offers a major unknown to most colleges. It was in this major that I discovered my passion for Human Computer Interaction. As an aspiring UX Designer, I yearn to not only work to solve problems, but also to meet people where they are and fulfill their unmet needs.</p></div>
			<div class='present'><h3>Present</h3><p>At the moment, I am currently ending my junior year at IU and am about to embark upon a UX internship with Sabre down in Southlake, TX for the summer. </p></div>
